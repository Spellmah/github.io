  	<p>My name is Harvey. I currently live in washington D.C. and have been here for two years. I enjoy traveling, working out and hanging with my friends and family. I recently took a great trip to Aruba and got to feed the flamingos. A goal of mine is to run a marathon next year. I'm excited to learn more about software design and development. I look forward to meeting you all.!</p>
